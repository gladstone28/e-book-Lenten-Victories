Introduction: The Call to Evangelism

In the heart of Kingston, Jamaica, the Bennett family—David, his wife Angela, and their three daughters, Naomi (16), Esther (14), and Ruthie (10)—find themselves on a transformative Lenten journey. What begins as a simple decision to observe Lent leads them into a deeper commitment to evangelism, shaping not only their faith but also the lives of those around them.

David, a devoted father and lay minister, gathers his family in the living room one evening.

David: “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matthew 28:19)

Angela nods in agreement.

Angela: “This is our mission as a family. Lent is not just about giving up something; it’s about giving more—more of our time, more of our hearts, and more of our faith.”

Thus begins their journey of spreading the Gospel in their community.

Chapter 1: Ash Wednesday – The Beginning of the Journey

The family attends an early morning service where they receive ashes on their foreheads. As they leave, Ruthie looks up at her mother.

Ruthie: “Why do we have ashes, Mommy?”

Angela: “It’s a sign of repentance and humility before God. ‘For you are dust, and to dust you shall return.’” (Genesis 3:19)

Later that day, the family sets out into their neighborhood, handing out Lenten devotionals. They meet an elderly woman, Miss Ivy, who hasn’t been to church in years.

Naomi: “Miss Ivy, would you like to come to service with us on Sunday?”

Miss Ivy hesitates, but David encourages her gently.

David: “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28)

By the end of the evening, Miss Ivy promises to think about it. The family prays together, asking God to touch hearts during their Lenten mission.

Chapter 2: Palm Sunday – A Celebration with Purpose

The streets of Kingston are alive with the sound of drums and singing as the Bennetts join their church’s Palm Sunday procession. With palm branches in hand, they reenact Jesus’ triumphant entry into Jerusalem.

Esther: “Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!” (Mark 11:9)

As they walk through the community, they meet young boys playing football. David stops to talk to them about the significance of the day, and soon, a group of them joins the procession.

Chapter 3: Holy Monday – Lessons in Faith

At school, Naomi and Esther notice a classmate, Lisa, crying. She explains that her family is struggling and she feels lost.

Naomi: “The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves the crushed in spirit.” (Psalm 34:18)

The sisters invite Lisa to their youth Bible study that evening. Through prayer and encouragement, Lisa finds new hope.

Chapter 4: Holy Tuesday – The Power of Testimony

David shares his personal testimony at a men’s gathering, recounting how his faith helped him overcome trials. His words inspire a young father, Brian, who has been struggling with addiction.

David: “Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)

Chapter 5: Spy Wednesday – A Test of Loyalty

The family reflects on Judas’ betrayal. Angela reminds them:

Angela: “Let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.” (1 John 3:18)

They decide to write letters of encouragement to those who have strayed from the church, inviting them back.

Chapter 6: Maundy Thursday – Servanthood and Sacrifice

The Bennetts participate in a foot-washing service, learning the importance of humility and love.

David: “For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve.” (Mark 10:45)

Chapter 7: Good Friday – The Cost of Redemption

The family attends a reenactment of Jesus’ crucifixion. Naomi, moved to tears, prays for their community’s salvation.

Naomi: “But He was wounded for our transgressions; He was crushed for our iniquities.” (Isaiah 53:5)

Chapter 8: Holy Saturday – Waiting in Expectation

The family spends the day fasting and praying, preparing their hearts for the joy of Easter.

Chapter 9: Resurrection Sunday – Victory and New Life

At sunrise service, Miss Ivy, Lisa, and Brian all join them at church. As the choir sings, Miss Ivy whispers:

Miss Ivy: “He is not here, for He has risen!” (Matthew 28:6)

Tears of joy flow as the Bennetts witness the fruit of their evangelism.

Conclusion: The Journey Continues

Their Lenten mission has ignited a passion for evangelism in their hearts. As they gather that evening, David reminds them:

David: “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few.” (Luke 10:2)

With renewed faith, they commit to continuing their mission beyond Lent.
